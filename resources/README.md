### Resources

- supplementary_information.pdf, has information and pseudo codes related to the paper we are working on.
- TensorReview.pdf, helped us to understand the what tensors are and also about tensor decompositions.
- alphazero_preprint.pdf, is a document which is a general reinforcement learning algorithm that masters chess, shogi and Go through self-play
- We used the following github link to understand general alphazero algorithms - `https://github.com/suragnair/alpha-zero-general`
